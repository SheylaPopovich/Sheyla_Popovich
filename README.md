<h1 align="center" style="color:blue"> Hey there!! I'm Sheyla Popovich ✌️👩🏻‍💻 </h1>

<img align="left" src="assets\images\me_camera.jpg" width="160" height="210" style="margin-right: 10px"/> <p> Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently in the medical field transitioning into the  exciting world of coding. I have a strong passion for learning and unleashing my creativity in a prosperous way. Within my portfolio you will see newly developed CSS skills like "flexbox" features while also maintaining "responsive design" for multiple screens. I have showcased my personal photography by using "advance box styling". Creating this portfolio has allowed me to understand the important need for a strong wireframe in order to execute a compelling yet effective webpage.  

During your visit if you come across a project or something that has sparked your interest, please feel free to reach out at ✉️ SheylaPopovich@gmail.com. The creativity doesn't stop here I invite you to explore some of my other media pages listed below. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power and sharing that knowledge is incredibly prevailing. Shoot me a message with any inquires you may have or if you would like to collaborate!</p>
